## About CKB

CKB is the layer 1 of Nervos Network, a public/permissionless blockchain. CKB uses [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and [improved Nakamoto consensus](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/breaking-the-throughput-limit-of-nakamoto-consensus-ccdf65fe0832) to achieve maximized performance on average hardware and internet condition, without sacrificing decentralization and security which are the core value of blockchain.

CKB supports scripting in any programming language with its own [CKB-VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm/), a virtual machine fully compatible with RISC-V ISA. CKB is a [General Verification Network](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/https-medium-com-nervosnetwork-cell-model-7323fca57571), its programming model focuses on state verification, leaves state generation to layer 2 applications/protocols.

[Nervos project](https://www.nervos.org) defines [a suite of scalable and interoperable blockchain protocols](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs) to create a self-evolving distributed economy, [CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0002-ckb/0002-ckb.md) is among them.

Support for different platforms are organized into [three tiers](docs/platform-support.md), each with a different set of guarantees.

**Notice**: The ckb process will send stack trace to sentry on Rust panics. This is enabled by default before the mainnet launch, which can be opted out by setting
the option `dsn` to empty in the config file.

## Join a Network

- Mainnet Lina: Use the [latest release](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases/latest) and run `ckb init --chain mainnet` to initialize the node.
- Testnet Aggron: Use the [latest release](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases/latest) and run `ckb init --chain testnet` to initialize the node.

See more networks to join in the [wiki](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/wiki/Chains).


## Mining

CKB uses the [Eaglesong](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0010-eaglesong/0010-eaglesong.md) mining algorithm.


## Development Process

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested. It is considered already production ready; The `develop` branch is the work branch to merge new features, and it's not stable. The CHANGELOG is available in [Releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases) and [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the `master` branch.


## How to Contribute

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and security policy is described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). To propose new protocol or standard for Nervos, see [Nervos RFC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs).
